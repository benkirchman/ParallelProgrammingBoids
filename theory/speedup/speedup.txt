1. Speedup is comparrison of single worker performance versus multi worker performance.
2. Efficiency is the speedup per worker.
3. a) The span is 3.
   b) With a single processor the runtime is 5s * 6 tasks = 30s
   c) With two processors the runtime is 20s so the speedup is 30s/20s =  1.5. The efficiency is 1.5/2 = .75.
   d) With 4 processors the runtime is 15s so the speedup is 30/15 = 2. The efficiency is 2/4 = .5.
   e) With 10 processors the speedup stays the same as with 4 (2) and the efficiency is 2/10 = .2.
   f) To get a speedup of 10 we can solve the equation 10 = 30 / x for x = 3. It is impossible to get a runtime of 3 with this graph because the tasks all take 5s of runtime. Without breaking down these tasks more the fastest this graph can be run is 15 seconds.
4. a) The minimum possible latency is the slower of light moving 10cm and one cycle of the processor. In this scenario 3*10^8 m/s / 100cm * 10cm = 3*10^9 which is the same as the clock speed. 
   b) Because the bus has a cycle speed of 3ghz and a width of 256 3*(256/8) = 96GB/s, which is rediculous.
