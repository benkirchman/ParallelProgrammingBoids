Moore's law is the idea that the number of transistors in a chip will double every 2 years. This is important to computing because it meant that computers would continue becoming faster even if the instructions were the same because the clock speed was also increasing. Post 2005 processors are limited by the three walls: the power wall, instruciton-level parallelism wall, and the memory wall. The clock rates of modern chips have remained about the same since 2005 due to these three walls. Parallelism is now the only way to increase the speed of a program because the speed of a single core has been capped at about 3GHZ.

FLOPS depends on how much data a processor can process during one cycle (design), how many cycles the processor can perform per second (clock speed), and how many cores it has. Seeing as clock speed is only one of those three characteristics, if a 500mhz processor has 4 cores and has a better architecture it would probably outperform a 1ghz 2 core processor. 

FLOPS is one way to measure computing capability. FLOPS stands for floating point operations per second. FLOPS is useful because it indicates the overall ability of a computer to compute floating point operations. It can be misleading if processors are faster or slower at different operations.
Another way is with clock speed. Clock speed is a measure of how many cycles can be performed in a cpu per second. It is a good hardware metric, but doesnt really convey the total processing power because different cpu architectures are capable of doint different ammounts of computation in a cycle.
A third method to compare computing capability is with cores. Depending on how well computing on a machine is parallelized more cores can increase performance. Having more cores doesn't directly translate into capability because the cores could be slower or be able to do less work per cycle.
